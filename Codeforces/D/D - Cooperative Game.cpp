Subproblem 1- Finding "entrance" in a cycle
We can simply find distance fast is from entrance when slow enters
cycle fast decreases distance by 1, thus fast's distance from entrance is
o<-o distance is shown as such (theres paper image that looks better i swear)
will meet distance away.

Subproblem 2 - finding t and c
Find C - Move 1 until meets, this is C (unnecssary?)
Find T - remember slow moved x units, thus x - distance = t

Move all pieces
